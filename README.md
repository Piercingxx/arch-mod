### A script to setup my version of Arch Linux


I recommend running all the options in order



- Update System will find the fastest mirrors and update the system.

- Add Paru, Flatpak, & Dependencies will do just that. It will auto reboot the system after. Run the script again to run everything else.

- Applications will install all the applications I use.

- Hyprland will install Hyprland and all the dependencies for my build of Hyprland.

- Gnome Extensions will install all the Gnome Extensions I use as well as customize Gnome with my custom extension settings.

- Surface Kernel will install the Surface Kernel for any Microsoft Surface device.
